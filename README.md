# Pacman

## Description
In this project, the Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. I have built general search algorithms and applied them to Pacman scenarios.

Full instructions are avialable here: http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html

You can run all of the test cases on your code by opening a terminal and executing the command:

    $ python autograder.py

You can also run individual test cases by executing the command (you can replace "q1" with any of the choices q1-q8):

    $ python autograder.py -q q1

## Notes
- The pacman.py script will animate the agent searching various domains (see commands.txt for instructions).
