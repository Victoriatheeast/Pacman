#Pacman

##Description
In this project, your Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. You will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.

You only need to modify search.py and searchAgents.py, and you only need to run autograder.py to complete the exercise. Full instructions are avialable here: http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html

You can run all of the test cases on your code by opening a terminal and executing the command:

    $ python autograder.py

You can also run individual test cases by executing the command (you can replace "q1" with any of the choices q1-q8):

    $ python autograder.py -q q1

##Notes
- The pacman.py script will animate your agent searching various domains (see commands.txt for instructions), but IT WILL NOT RUN IN THE WORKSPACE. You must download your code to run the GUI.
